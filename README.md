Evolutionary Computation 2014 - Practical Assignment: Evolutionary Algorithms to Solve the Traveling Salesman Problem

### Instructions:
build.sh/clean.sh/run.sh are provided and do the obvious.

### EA1 vs EA2
* The files marked with '2', e.g. TravelingSalesman2.java, EA-TSP2.htm correspond to our more basic GA (order crossover + swap mutator).
* To run the simpler EA, run './run2.sh' or open EA-TSP.htm

### Data
* Raw CSV result data for 50 runs for 100 cities and 200 cities is in the 'data' folder.
